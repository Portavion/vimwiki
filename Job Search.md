### Cover Letter

```Hi there, Guillaume here,

My name is Guillaume (Ghee - YOHM)I love [I[NSERT COMPANY NAME] cool product and your approach to team collaboration and transparency and I think there could be a great mutual fit.

My GitHub [INSERT LINK] provides a quick summary of myself but here are some key points:

- I am currently switching career to software development. The past couple years, all the Python automation and database tasks have been what I've enjoyed working on the most. I am looking for a job that allows me to continuously learn and discover new things and software developer is the perfect industry for this.

- I have 6 years of experience as transport modeller where I mostly did data analysis job working with large relational databases (mostly MySQL) to process our model outputs. I've also done some work automating some of our modelling workflows through our software Python COM interface. There is a lot of manual input in creating our transport model which can be slow and prone to user errors. I've also done some work with our digital team designing  web dashboard that allows relevant stakeholders to visualise the impact of their policy on future carbon emissions and help them reach net zero. While I didn't work directly on the web app I created a prototype CLI tool in Python.

- I've worked in both very small teams (4-5 people) and large multi-disciplinary projects and I thrive in smaller teams. It allows fast learning through knowledge sharing and quick iteration.

- I've learned mostly through reading documentations and personal projects. You can find some example on my GitHub repo. I'm currently building a climbing companion app [INSERT LINK] to track my sessions and give data (ala strava) and I've also built a web app [INSERT LINK]  to track Santander docking stations data and save / organise them into collections, which the official app is not great at. (I also like to think my search algorithm gives better results). Nothing to boast about but a few friends are using it daily!

I am currently interviewing for [GRADUATE / JUNIOR / INTERNSHIP] jobs and am I at different stages with a couple different companies. I am targetting June as my start date but happy to adjust if needed.

Thank you for the opportunity to apply for [INSERT COMPANY NAME]. Here is a link to my LinkedIn profile and I'm also attaching my resume.

All the best,
Guillaume

My name is Guillaume (Ghee - YOHM). I love [COMPANY] focus in developing customer focused solutions and your commitment to support your employees in their development and I think there could be a great mutual fit.

My GitHub [https://github.com/Portavion] provides a quick overview of my projects and here are some key points about myself:

I'm currently building a climbing companion app [https://github.com/Portavion/Chalkr] to track my sessions and give data (ala strava) and I've also built a web app [https://github.com/Portavion/velock]  to track Santander docking stations data and save / organise them into collections, which the official app is not great at. (I also like to think my search algorithm gives better results). Nothing to boast about but a few friends are using it daily! They are using React for the frontend, NodeJS for the backend and a PostgreSQL database.

I am currently interviewing for [JUNIOR/GRADUATE] jobs and I am at different stages with a couple different companies. I am targeting June as my start date but happy to adjust if needed.

Thank you for the opportunity to apply for Smart Communications.

All the best,
Guillaume

### Short career switch pitch
```
I am currently transitioning into software engineering. Although my previous roles were in a different field I gained working experience with Python developing automation scripts interfacing with modelling software and working on large databases. I am excited to join a startup environment where I could contribute to rapid development and significantly accelerate my learning.
** Why I am interested in the position
I strongly align with your vision of career progression. I appreciate the effort in your job ad as to who you are looking for and what you offer and I am looking for a company that cares about their employees.

I am a self starter and fast learner. I have been teaching myself mostly through documentation. I am always eager to learn more. I am currently focused on learning code architecture, clean code and how to write code that is easily testable and maintainable. An area where I feel it's unfortunately harder to find great learning material.

This is mostly why I am looking for a strong collaborating team like yours where I can further push my development and skills.

## Questions to ask
- Does the company have product-market fit?
- How much runway does the company have?
- If and solve it immediately, what would it be?
