Today is the first day that I installed VimWiki. Maybe I can replace my paper bullet journal worflow here.

I have spent a bunch of time creating basic notes and I quite like vimwiki. I think it would work well if I can manage to get a good integration with taskWarrior. The only issue is whether I can make it work with my phone or not.

I started keeping some notes about data structure and algorithm in an effort to really improve my basic programming knowledge and not struggle with assignment ever again.
