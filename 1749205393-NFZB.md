# Dijkstra's Algorithm

It is a popular algorithm for solving single-source shortest path problems with
non-negative edge weight in a graph. I.e. shortest distance between two
vertices in a graph.

It works on both directed and undirected graphs.

## Algorithm

1. Set the initial distance of the source vertex to 0 and everything else to infinity.
2. Choose the vertex with the shortest distance from the start to be the current
   vertex.
3. For each unvisited neighbor, calculate the distance from the source and
   update the distance if the new calculated distance is lower.
4. Mark the current vertex as visited.
5. Go back to step 2 and chose a new vertex. Keep repeating until all the
   vertices are visited.
6. In the end, we are left with the shortest path from the source to every
   other vertex in the graph.
