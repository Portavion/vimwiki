# Graphs

A graph, data structure, is a collection of **nodes** connected by **edges** used to represent relationships between different entities.

## Basics
* [Introduction to graphs](Introduction to graphs.md)
* Graph representations
* Creating a graph

## Problems
* [BFS traversal of graphs](BFS traversal of graphs.md)
* DFS traversal of graphs
* Shortest path - unweighted graphs
* Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
