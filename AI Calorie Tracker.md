# Calorie tracker with AI features
Calorie tracker that allows a user to easily enter everything he eats.

It needs to be able to fetch nutrition facts in several ways:
- AI picture that is automatically analyse (see React Native simon youtube channel)
- Type the name of the food and lookup the OpenFoodFact API
- Enter a link to a recipe and parse the ingredients
- Take a picture of a list of ingredients in a recip book and parse the ingredients
- Take a picture of the nutritional facts and create a new ingredient based on that (then send for review so that I can add to my own db)
