# Menu morning routine app

Based on this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj1hmr1oNjw)

where you can choose what you want to do based on the current mood:
eg. you want to do some exercise every morning then based on your energy you can choose between running, yoga, quick hiit etc.
Same thing for food you can have differnt plans like cooking from scratch, frozen ready breakfast, only buying a croissant and making the rest etc... (with the worst being take out if it was for planning meals)
