# Python init

init() method in Python is used to initialise objects of a class. 
It is also called a constructor. Constructors are used to initialize the objectâ€™s state.

The task of constructors is to initialize (assign values) to data members of the class when an object of the class is created. 
Like methods, a constructor also contains a collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at the time of Object creation. 
It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated.

All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.

Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:

Create a class named Person, use the __init__() function to assign values for name and age:
```python
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("John", 36)
```
